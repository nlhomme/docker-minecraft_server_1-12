# Minecraft server for dummies

(Very) Easily install a minecraft server directly on your machine or inside a Docker container

# Requirement (Docker part): 
Docker Engine 17.09+
Docker-compose 1.18.0

# How to make it run:
- Clone the repo (No, really?)
- Run setup-wizard.sh as root
- Follow the instructions
- Play!

# To-Do:
- Take in charge your already existing minecraft save.
- Install the minecraft version of your choice (currently installs 1.12)
- Fix this problem: when the container is stopped, everythin is lost. I don't now (for the moment) how to stop it properly...
